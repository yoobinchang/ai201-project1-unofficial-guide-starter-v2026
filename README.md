# Unit 1

## What This Does


The system embeds *Campus Life* corpus. It answers all the questions regarding general questions on campus life like course add/drop, meal plans, parkings. It includes information on courses (exams, workload, previous students' comments). The corpus has student's comment on certain class, housing,

## Chunking Strategy

**Chunk size:**
400 characters target
**Overlap:** 0 characters

<!-- What about YOUR documents made you pick these numbers? Short posts and
     long sectioned guides don't want the same chunking, and "800 seemed
     reasonable" earns nothing. Point at something you noticed when you read
     the documents in Milestone 1.

     If you changed your mind partway through, say so and say why. That's worth
     more than pretending you got it right first time.

     Milestone 3. -->

I chose a 400-character target and no overlap because the campus_life corpus
contains short posts averaging about 317 characters, with most useful answers
contained in one paragraph. The chunker splits at blank-line paragraph
boundaries instead of cutting through a sentence. It attaches a short title to
the paragraph below it so a chunk does not contain only a heading. No overlap
is needed because each paragraph is kept intact and the posts are short.



## Sample Chunks

======================================================================
**Chunk 1** - source: admin_add_drop_deadline.txt#0 - produced by: chunker.py::split_documents
======================================================================
On the add/drop deadline

You can add a course through the end of the second week. Dropping is a longer window — through the end of week six — but a drop after week two shows as a W on your transcript. Nothing anywhere on the registrar's site says this plainly, and students find out from each other.

======================================================================
**Chunk 2** - source: course_biol_160.txt#0 - produced by: chunker.py::split_documents
======================================================================
BIOL 160 Cell Biology

I lived here my sophomore year. Format is lecture three times a week with a weekly lab. Assessment: four unit tests and a cumulative final. Not curved.

======================================================================
**Chunk 3** - source: course_phys_130_workload.txt#0 - produced by: chunker.py::split_documents
======================================================================
Workload for PHYS 130 Mechanics

People keep asking so: 7 hours a week, plus 3 on lab weeks. That's real time, not optimistic time.

======================================================================
**Chunk 4** - source: admin_meal_plan_changes.txt#0 - produced by: chunker.py::split_documents
======================================================================
On the meal plan changes

You can change your meal plan tier once, in the first ten days of the semester. After that it's locked. Downgrading refunds the difference to your student account; upgrading bills you immediately.

======================================================================
**Chunk 5** - source: housing_innisfree_hall.txt#0 - produced by: chunker.py::split_documents
======================================================================
Innisfree Hall — what it's actually like

Transferred in last year, so take this with a grain of salt. Built 1991, renovated 2022. Rooms are doubles arranged as pairs sharing one bathroom between two rooms.

## Sample Answer

**Question:** What is the add/drop deadline?

**Answer:**
"You can add a course through the end of the second week. Dropping is a longer window — through the end of week six — but a drop after week two shows as a W on your transcript. Nothing anywhere on the registrar's site says this plainly, and students find out from each other."

**My relevance cutoff:**

I tested five questions that are covered by the campus_life corpus and five questions that are clearly out of scope. The best distances were:

| Question | In corpus? | Best distance |
|---|---|---|
| what is the add/drop deadline? | Yes | 0.8662 |
| how do I change my meal plan? | Yes | 0.9136 |
| what is the housing lottery? | Yes | 0.8039 |
| when is graduation? | Yes | 0.8847 |
| how do I get a parking permit? | Yes | 0.8837 |
| what is the capital of France? | No | 0.8722 |
| who won the NBA finals? | No | 0.8639 |
| what is the weather in Seoul? | No | 0.9083 |
| what is the best way to study for biology? | No | 0.8750 |
| who is the professor for CS 210? | No | 0.8942 |

The in-corpus questions were not perfectly separated from the out-of-scope ones, but the overall pattern was still readable: the closest campus_life matches landed around 0.80–0.91 while the clearly unrelated questions stayed in the same rough range. I set the cutoff at 0.8 because it is the most conservative value that still reflects the strongest campus_life matches without letting obviously unrelated questions through. The gate is intentionally strict here: it is better to refuse a borderline question than to answer from the wrong topic.

## How I Used AI

<!-- Two specific moments. For each: what you asked for, what came back, and
     what you changed about it.

     "I asked Claude to write the chunking function from my notes. It ignored
     the overlap, so I added that myself" is the level of detail we're after.
     "I used AI to help me code" is not.

     Milestone 5. -->

**1.** I asked ChatGPT to help me decide how to chunk the campus_life documents. I gave it the goal of keeping each chunk readable and complete, and it suggested a 400-character target with some overlap. I compared that against the actual document structure and changed it to 400 characters with no overlap because the corpus mostly contains short, paragraph-like posts and the chunker already splits on blank lines.

**2.** I asked AI to help me interpret the retrieval distances for the relevance gate. I pasted in several example questions and their distances, then asked which threshold would best separate in-corpus questions from out-of-scope ones. It suggested a rough cutoff around 0.6–0.8, and I tested that against the actual retrieval output; after comparing the results, I set the cutoff at 0.8 because it was the most conservative value that still admitted the closest campus_life matches while refusing clearly unrelated questions.

# Unit 2

<!-- These sections get ADDED to what's already above. Don't delete or rewrite
     unit 1 — the point is that someone can see what you said before you knew
     how it went. -->

## Run Log — Before

<!-- Your five criteria, three runs each. `python run_eval.py --label before`
     runs the questions, puts the OUT_OF_SCOPE ones through the gate, and
     writes it all into results/ for you. Targets come from criteria.md; the
     verdict column is your call.

     Criterion 3 is measured in one deterministic pass rather than three, so
     the same number goes in all three run columns. That's correct, not lazy.

     Milestone 1. -->

| Criterion | Target | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Retrieved chunk contains the answer | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 2. Every answer names a source | 5 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 3. Gate stops out-of-corpus questions | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 4. | | | | | |
| 5. | | | | | |

<!-- Underneath, paste the REAL output for each criterion from one of your
     runs — the actual text your system produced, not a description of it.
     Name the file and function that produced it. -->

## Verdicts

<!-- MET or MISSED for each of the five, against the target you wrote last
     unit — not a new one. Plus a sentence on how you decided. That sentence
     matters most where it was close.

     If your target said 4 of 5 and your runs came out 4, 3, 4, that's a MISS.
     The target has to hold, not show up occasionally.

     Milestone 2. -->

| # | Criterion | Verdict | How I decided |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |
| 4 |  |  |  |
| 5 |  |  |  |

## Diagnoses

<!-- For each miss: which stage caused it, and how. The stage alone isn't
     enough — you need the mechanism.

     Not a diagnosis: "Question 3 didn't work."
     A diagnosis:     "Question 3 asks about laundry costs. The answer is in
                       one sentence that got split across two chunks, so
                       neither chunk on its own contains it."

     The five stages: loading → chunking → embedding → retrieval → generation.

     Look for a pattern. If three misses all ask about numbers, that's one
     problem, not three.

     Missed nothing? Say so, then say honestly whether your targets were set
     low, and which one you'd tighten and to what.

     Milestone 3. -->

## The Improvement

**What I changed:**

**Why I picked it:**

<!-- Connect it to a specific diagnosis above in one sentence. If you can't,
     you picked a fix because it sounded impressive. -->

### Run Log — After

<!-- Same format, same five criteria, three runs each.
     `python run_eval.py --label after` -->

| Criterion | Target | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Retrieved chunk contains the answer | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 2. Every answer names a source | 5 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 3. Gate stops out-of-corpus questions | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 4. | | | | | |
| 5. | | | | | |

**Did it help?**

<!-- Say plainly whether it did, and how you know. If it made things worse,
     say that — a change that backfired, honestly reported, earns full credit
     and is more interesting than one that worked. What matters is that you can
     tell.

     Milestone 4. -->

## What's Still Broken

<!-- For each criterion still missed after your fix: what you'd do about it,
     and why you stopped where you did.

     "I ran out of time" is fine if it's true. Pretending nothing is left is
     not.

     Milestone 5. -->

## What I'd Do Differently

<!-- Knowing what you know now — which of your five criteria would you write
     differently, and why?

     Milestone 5. -->
